### Cool Projects 

[The Lymph Corset](https://inventionfactory.org/inventions/lymph-corset)

The Lymph Corset is a vibrational compression garment for breast cancer survivors to prevent lymphedema, or the swelling of lymph nodes. A torque-limiting ratcheting knob was designed to evenly apply compression to the garment, and vibration motors are placed throughout the garment to stimulate the flow of lymphatic fluid throughout the body.

[Flexible Circuit on SCOBY](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)

SCOBY is the byproduct of kombucha tea, and research was conducted to find a sustainable alternative to use SCOBY as a flexible wearable electronic device. In a dried state, SCOBY forms a fabric, leather-like material that can be used in various ways. I purified and prepped SCOBY to be easily manufacturable and developed a novel way to make a circuit on a flexible material as a sustainable alternative to flexible circuits on the market.

[Crab Rave](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)

The Crab Rave is an autonomous mobile robot that was created to compete in the Fall 2024 Robot Tank Competition at the Cooper Union. It is an omnidirectional robot that can avoid obstacles, return to its home base, and shoot a ping pong ball at either its opponent or opponent's base. It operates using an arduino mega, mecanum wheels, DC motors, ultrasonic sensors, and ir sensors.
